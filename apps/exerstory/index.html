            <p class="description">
                Are you tired of boring routines? <strong>ExerStory</strong> transforms your daily fitness regime into an immersive workout game. Powered by intelligent AI, ExerStory generates unique, interactive tales where you are the protagonist, and your physical performance determines the plot.

            <p class="description">
                If you have been searching for a motivating workout that actually keeps you engaged, this is it. You aren't just doing push-ups in your living room; you are diving for cover during a bank heist. You aren't just holding a plank; you are hiding in the shadows to avoid detection.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <div class="features">
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>1. Choose Your Adventure</h3>
                    <p>Type in any prompt (e.g., "A spy escaping a facility" or "A knight defending the realm") or let the AI surprise you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>2. Read Your Workout Story</h3>
                    <p>The app generates a thrilling narrative segment ending in a cliffhanger.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>3. Do Simple Exercises</h3>
                    <p>The story assigns a physical action (e.g., Tactical Crouch = Squats).</p>

                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>4. Shape the Narrative</h3>
                    <p><strong>Success:</strong> You complete the reps? Your character succeeds, gaining the upper hand.<br>
                    <strong>Failure:</strong> Can't hold the plank? Your character cramps, trips, or gets spotted, forcing the story down a harder path.</p>

                    <h3>💪 The Most Motivating Workout on Android</h3>
                    <p>The adrenaline of the plot pushes you to finish that last rep just to find out what happens next. By turning fitness into a narrative experience, ExerStory provides a motivating workout that makes you forget you are even exercising.</p>
